# inversion-counter
## What is this?
A Python3 program that takes in an unsorted array of integers from a file and utilizes an optimal merge sort implementation to count the amount of inversions, which it will print to stdout.

## How do I use this?
Use the file as follows:
```shell
chmod +x invcalc.py
./invcalc.py input_file.txt
```

## Why did you make this?
I wanted to review my skills in Python3. It was also for a programming assignment for an Algorithms course.
